            <h4>Operating Systems</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A collection of programs that provide an interface between the user and computer</li>
                <li>Provide the following features:</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Memory management</li>
                    <li>Resource management eg. scheduling</li>
                    <li>File management</li>
                    <li>Input/ Output management</li>
                    <li>GInterrupt management</li>
                    <li>Utility software</li>
                    <li>Security</li>
                    <li>User interface</li>
                </ul>
            </ul>

            <h4>Memory Management</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Types of memory management - </li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Paging</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory is split up into equal-sized sections known as pages.</li>
                        <li>Pages are swapped between main memory and the hard disk as needed.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Segmentation</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Memory is split up into logical sized divisions, called segments.</li>
                        <li>Segments vary in size</li>
                        <li>Segments represent the structure and logical flow of the program.</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Virtual Memory</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>A section of the hard drive acts as RAM when the space in main memory is insufficient to store programs being used. </li>
                <li>Sections of programs not currently being used are temporarily moved into virtual memory through paging.</li>
                <li>This frees up memory for other programs in RAM.</li>
                <li>The key issue with using these techniques is disk thrashing, when the computer 'freezes' due to pages being swapped too frequently between the hard disk and main memory.</li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section>
            <h4>Interrupts</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Signals generated by software or hardware to indicate to the processor that a process needs attention.</li>
                <li>Interrupts have different priorities and this is considered when allocating processor time.</li>
                <li>They are stored within an abstract data structure called a priority queue in an interrupt register.</li>
            </ul>
